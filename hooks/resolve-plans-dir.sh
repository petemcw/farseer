#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Farseer plans-directory resolution — where this project keeps its plan folders.
#
# Defaults to <project>/.farseer/plans. A project may override it with an
# optional, user-owned .farseer/config.json:
#
#   { "plansDir": "docs/plans" }
#
# No skill creates or modifies that file. Its absence is the normal case.
#
# Two deliberate departures from a naive one-liner:
#
#   1. No `jq`. A `jq ... || echo <default>` pipeline turns a missing jq — the
#      norm on Debian minimal and Alpine — into a silent fallback: you set
#      plansDir, you get .farseer/plans, and nothing says why.
#   2. A malformed plansDir is an error, not a fallback. Writing plans to a
#      directory the project did not ask for is worse than refusing, and it
#      matches how an invalid `phase` already aborts discovery.
#
# The project root comes from resolve-project-dir.sh, so the answer does not
# depend on the working directory. Output is absolute for the same reason:
# callers pass it to sub-agents whose cwd is not knowable from here.
#
# Usage:
#   resolve-plans-dir.sh          # print the absolute plans directory
#   . resolve-plans-dir.sh        # define resolve_plans_dir
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  resolved; the absolute path is on stdout
#   1  unresolvable project root, or an invalid plansDir value

# read is reported by the caller as absent, which falls back to the default.
#
# Line-oriented, so it does not understand nesting: a plansDir buried inside
# another object would be read as if top-level. config.json is a flat file the user
# writes by hand and nesting this key means nothing, so that is a documented
# limit rather than a reason to put a JSON parser in bash. Duplicate keys take
# the last, and a padded value keeps its padding — both match what `jq` returns.
